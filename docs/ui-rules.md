# UI rules

Approved by Roman on 2026-11-12. The tokens live in `src/kit/glass.rs` (`sp::*`, `ty::*`, `R_*`); use them, not raw numbers.

| # | Rule | Token |
|---|------|-------|
| R1 | Content starts 24 pt from the window edge, header included. | `sp::PAGE_EDGE` |
| R2 | Cards: padding 16, gap 16, radius 12. Title, 12, content. A section title sits 12 above its card. | `sp::L`, `sp::M`, `R_CARD` |
| R3 | Two row heights: settings rows 40 (label left, control right, hairline between), list rows 44 (icon, name, detail). | `sp::SETTINGS_ROW_H`, `sp::ROW_H` |
| R4 | Rows with a bar: 36 tall, name and value on one line, a 4 pt bar 8 pt under them. | `sp::BAR_ROW_H` |
| R5 | Controls are 28 inside cards and 32 in page headers. | `sp::CONTROL_H`, `sp::HEADER_CONTROL_H` |
| R6 | One empty state: centred, 56 icon chip, lead title, body up to 400 wide in dim, one secondary button. Inside a card: one caption-size line in the middle. | `sp::XXL` around it |
| R7 | Chips say a state (Normal, Charging, In menu bar), never an action: 11/600 on a 16% tint. | `chip()` |
| R8 | Numbers in lists and tables are right-aligned. | |
| R9 | A title with a detail line under it ("Ollama" over "com.ollama.ollama") keeps 6 between the lines; such rows are 52 tall. Columns in a row sit 16 apart. | `sp::LINE_GAP`, `two_lines_y()`, `sp::ROW2_H`, `sp::COL_GAP` |
| R10 | Text the app writes (times, states, counts) is never cut with "…": it wraps or the layout changes. Only names and paths people bring (apps, files, projects) may be cut. Find cut text with `CMDMEOW_FIT_LOG=1`. | `text_wrap()` |
| R11 | A list's section title ("Open at login", "Today") is 12/600 in a 44 row: 16 above, 12 below to the first row; its link ("Open in System Settings") sits on the same line. A table's column heads sit in a 36 row with the hairline at its bottom. | `section_title()`, `sp::SECTION_H`, `sp::TABLE_HEAD_H` |
| R12 | Scroll bars float in a 14 gutter the content leaves on the right, so a hovered bar never covers a row or button. Content in a scroll area takes `ui.available_width()`, never the outer rect's width. | `sp::SCROLL_GUTTER` |

**Spacing scale:** 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32 (`sp::XS` to `sp::XXL`). Nothing in between.

**Type ramp:** hero 28/600, number 22/600, lead 15/600, title 13/600, section 12/600, body 13/400, label 12/400, caption 11/400 (`ty::*`). Bold 11 and 12 are allowed for chips and small values. Only exceptions: the speed dial (52) and the app mark (40).

## Writing text

Approved by Roman on 2026-11-14, after the text audit of all 101 screen states. A Mac utility explains itself through its layout: names, values and controls. Text that a person has to read before using the screen is a bug.

### Cut it

| # | Rule | Instead of | Write |
|---|------|------------|-------|
| T1 | No reassuring caption under a status. The status or chip already says it. | "Normal" + "Within the normal range." | "Normal" |
| T2 | One fact appears once per screen. Pick the place where it is read, drop the rest. | "80% limit" in the header, the ring and a row | the row only |
| T3 | Never explain the interface: how to click, where a setting lives, what a list contains, what to do later. | "Click a widget to resize it", "Each one says which tool uses it", "Come back and press Check again" | nothing |
| T4 | A row gets a reason only when the reason changes the decision (Needs your OK, Will quit Zoom). Safe rows need none. | "Rebuilt automatically" on every Safe row | nothing |
| T5 | A setting or tool description is at most 5 words, says what it does, and has no period. New users need it, so keep it, but never as a sentence. | "Keeps your Mac awake while an agent works on a task." | "Keep Mac awake" |
| T6 | macOS notes (system shortcuts, "macOS asks once") show only when they apply, for example on a real shortcut conflict. | a footnote that is always visible | a note on conflict only |
| T7 | Empty states: a title and one action. No paragraph about what will appear here. | "Plug in a display to adjust its brightness and…" | "No external displays" |

### No AI tone

| # | Rule | Instead of | Write |
|---|------|------------|-------|
| T8 | No taglines or slogans inside the app. | "14 tools. One menu bar." | nothing |
| T9 | States are plain words or numbers, not moods or metaphors. | "Room to spare", "Ahead of pace", "Sailing", "Mostly lean" | "42%", "Charge again below 75%" |
| T10 | Don't give the app or the user a voice: no "its call", "sleep in", "nudge", "4 can go". | "unsaved work stays its call" | "Zoom will quit first" |
| T11 | No summary sentence above a list that the list already shows. | "Two big folders you can drop" above the two folders | the list |
| T12 | No sparkle or magic glyphs for AI. AI is a feature with a name, not a mood. | ✦ AI Check | AI Check |
| T13 | No demo text that sounds like an ad. Demo data looks like real use. | "Okay, this is my first dictation and it already works." | an ordinary sentence |

### Make it clear without adding text

When something is unclear, name it with one or two words. Don't explain it in a sentence: that turns an "unclear" bug into a T1–T13 bug. If the name doesn't fit, use a hover tooltip.

| # | Rule | Instead of | Write |
|---|------|------------|-------|
| T14 | Every number and time says what it is, with a word or a symbol, never a bare value. | "17:04", "4 / 8", "1/2" | "Updated 17:04", "↻ 19:53", or drop it |
| T15 | One column, one kind of data. Don't mix counts, shortcuts and states in the same place. | sidebar right column: "11", "⇧⌘2", "Set up" | shortcuts only |
| T16 | A locked or disabled thing says what is missing, in the words of the fix. | lock icon; "Full Disk Access · Finding files to clean up" | "Needs Full Disk Access" |
| T17 | A big state and its control never disagree. If something else holds the state, say who. | "Awake" with the switch off | "Awake · by Claude" |
| T18 | A setting's name says what it does, not a nickname or an internal step. | "Put the clipboard back", "Step 1 of 2 · Looking for junk" | "Restore clipboard after typing", "Scanning…" |
| T19 | No rows of small unlabeled icons. Use words, or drop them. | tool icons next to each permission | "Used by Cleanup, Disk Map" on hover |
| T20 | A control with no label gets one, or goes. | a radio button next to a switch | a column head ("Main") |
